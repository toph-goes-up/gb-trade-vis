## Basic Info

Project title: Visualizing Imperial British Trade
Name: Christopher Kinsey

A#: 01784086
Repository: 

## Background and Motivation

I found this dataset while browsing the project resources. I was very interested in the paper published using the data, but there were no interesting visualizations associated with it. The data and paper describe how countries' trade relationships changed during colonization and after independence. I will focus particularly on Great Britain for this. I have always been fascinated by the economies of large empires, and 20th century Great Britain had the largest empire the world has ever seen, and there is plenty of data on it.

## Project Objectives

The visualizations will describe how former British colonies were affected economically by being colonized and gaining their independence. Naturally, different countries will be affected in different ways by these events, so I will provide a way to view specific relationships in greater detail. 

## Data

The datasets I will be using is hosted at http://econ.sciences-po.fr/thierry-mayer/data.

## Data Processing

The provided datasets have statistics covering every pair of countries 1948 - 2006. Much of this data will be irrelevant to my project, so I will filter out data covering countries that are not related to the British Empire. Most of the statistics required for the visualizations should already be present, but I may need to derive a simpler metric to describe trade relationships.

## Visualization Design

## Must-Have Features

The primary visualization will be an interactive map centered on Great Britain that shows its trade links, as well as the strength and direction of those links. It will also show whether countries are colonized or independent. Clicking on a country will open up detailed statistics for that country's trade relationship with Great Britain.

## Optional Featuers

Time permitting, I will add componenets to the visualizations that also highlight how former colonies trade with other countries as they gain their independence. This would be useful to give a better idea of how countries develop away from their former colonial masters, and whether or not there was a long-term positive impact on the independent economy due to colonial development.

## Project Schedule

I will be setting my due dates on Thursdays for my own convinience.

Nov 8: Have the dataset completely cleaned, processed, and imported into D3 in a suitable format.

Nov 15: Draw the map, showing Great Britian, its colonies, and lines linking them with some indication of trade strength. Animate the map over the time series.

Nov 22: Make the map interactive, showing details of the selected country's relationship with Great Britain over time.

Nov 29: Clean everything up, make sure everything is presentable, and submit the project.
